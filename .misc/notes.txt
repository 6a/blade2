4 of each card makes a deck of 44
However it seems that in reality there are some restrictions such as;
    - There only seems to be 2 of the 7pt card in a single Gameplay
    - Perhaps only 2 forces

TODO:
    - What happens if the player has only multiple special cards remaining after their turn?

Special rules:
    1. The 1pt card usually counts as a 1 point card, OR it will resurrect a card that was flipped by a bolt and get discarded instead.
    2. Effect cards cannot be used last - if the player only has a single, effect card left in their hand, they cannot play it [TODO is this an auto loss?]
    3. Special cards:
        a. Bolt: Flips the card last played by the oponent, removing its value from the opononents score [discarded after use]
        b. Mirror: Flips the playing field, switching both the played cards, and the scores, for each player [discarded after use]
        c. Blast: Randomly choose, and remove a card from the oponents hand [disarded after use]
        d. Force: Doubles the players score - [This card is placed on the field and can be bolted]
    4. If a special card is played with an empty field, it is considered to be worth 1 point and played without any further action
    5. If a round ends in a draw, causing the field to be cleared, and a player has an empty deck, they draw from their hand instead
    6. Apparently each deck is a subset of the whole set of cards, containing 5 extra cards

End conditions:
    1. Current player ended their turn without bringing their score above the oponents score
        a. [This is ignored if a non-scoring play was made such as a bolt or blast - in this scenario the player plays another turn]
    2. All cards are exhausted [TODO check]
    3. Current player ended their turn with only a special card in their hand
    4. [TODO invesigate end conditions]

Gameplay:
    Init:
        1. Cards are dealt. Each player receives a hand of 10 cards
            a. If [TODO condition?] cards shuffled and then re-dealt
        2. Cards are ordered within each players hand. Numerical with specials on the right. [TODO ordering of specials]
    Refresh:
        0. [If there are cards on the field, they are discarded]
        1. Both players draw a card from the top of their deck - This card is placed on the field and added to the respective players score
            a. If both players have the same score, the game goes back to [Game start]
        2. The player that drew the lower value card goes first
    Gameplay loop:
        1. Player draws a card from their hand and plays it
            a. Card action [if any] is performed
            b. If the card is a normal type or force, its added to the field
            c. If the added card is a normal type, the players score is increased accordingly
        3. If both players have the same score after the card is played, the game goes back to [Game start]
        4. [TODO investigate] check for end conditions
